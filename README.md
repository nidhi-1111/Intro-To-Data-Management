Performed data wrangling to handle missing records of "gross" by calculating threshold votes and compared them to
budget to set value higher and lower than 25% and plotted heatmap to find correlation. Generated EDA, identified
outliers and patterns, compared the results of K nearest Neighbors Classifier and Naive Bayes with 89.4% accuracy.
